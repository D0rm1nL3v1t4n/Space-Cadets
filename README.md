Challenge 1:
Using a webservice to get a person's name based on their email id from a webpage containing people's email ids and names through the HTML.


Challenge 2:
Building a bare bones interpreter based on the operations:
- `clear X;` - setting a variable X to a value of 0
- `incr X;` - increasing the value of a variable by 1
- `decr X;` - decreasing the value of a variable by 1
- `while X not 0 do;` - a loop that runs continuously until the variable X has a value of 0
- `end;` - the end of the section that is in the loop --> indicating that the loop has reached its end

Assumptions in my solution:
- No syntax errors
- All variables used are first declared using the `clear` operation before being used elsewhere (e.g. in a while loop).


Challenge 3
Extending the bare bones interpreter created in Challenge 2 to have more operations.
